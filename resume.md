Education
---------

1999-2000
:   **MSc, Real-Time Systems, Computer Engineering**;  University
    of Mälardalen (Västerås)

    *Thesis title: Modular Scheduling in RTLinux*, supervisors:
    Prof. Gerhard Fohler and Mikael Bergqvist, Frontec AB

1995-1999
:   **BSc, Computer Engineering**; University of Mälardalen (Västerås)


Experience
----------

**2005&mdash;Present: Software Architect, Westermo R&D**

Engineered and designed the WeOS network operating system, from the
ground up.

**2002mdash;2005: Consultant, Linux and embedded systems ÅF**

Consultant, Linux and embedded systems ÅF-System AB, Vasterås

* *2004: ABB Force Measurement — Network Security Analysis.* Security
  analysis and firewall recommendations for connecting a time critical
  industrial network to an office network with Internet access.  The
  Stressometer flatness measuring system is an advanced flatness system
  for rolling mills with high demands on network load predictability and
  quality of service.

* *2002–2005: EssNet AB — Linux USB2 drivers.* Development of several
  Linux kernel device drivers for a highly advanced lottery system.  In
  particular a Cypress FX2 (USB 2.0) based high–speed scanner with
  functions for scanning and calibration, branding of printed receipts,
  cashdrawer and dedicated serial port interface. First devleoped for
  Linux kernel 2.4 and later ported to Linux 2.6.
  
  Also responsible for continous maintenance of drivers and Linux system
  software, at EssNet.

**2000-2002: R&D Engineer, RealFast Operating Systems**

R&D Engineer, RealFast Operating Systems AB, Västerås.

* *2002: Mentor Graphics Inc. — Development project in Linux.* A six
  month project for Mentor Graphics to port Linux to the RealFast HW
  microkernel, similar to the VxWorks project (below).  Testbench (a S/W
  simulator of the microkernel), complete system including drivers
  redesign of the scheduler etc., all developed using GNU/Linux.

  Debugging of the ARM Integrator platform with the Arm AxD debugger
  using a MultiICE JTAG probe.

* *2001: Mälardalen University, Västerås.* Lecturer and examiner for a
  course in C programming at the Department of Computer Engineering,
  IDt.  For details: <http://www.idt.mdh.se/kurser/cd5020/jnnht01/>

* *2001: Sierra S16.* Project lead and SW developer for the Sierra
  real-time kernel.  A minimalistic OS based on the RealFast HW
  microkernel wrapped with a SW API to the hardware coupled with an
  adaptation of NewLib to provide a limited C library.

  Used today in courses given at Mälardalen University.

* *2001: Ericsson Radio Systems AB, Nacka Strand.* Investigation and
  demostration of how Linux and RTLinux can replace Enea OSE in Ericsson
  switches based on the GPB2, General Purpose Board 2.

* *2001: Applied Linux & Embedded Internet Show, Kista.* Presented, on
  5th April, Linux and other free kernels for embedded and real-time
  systems.  A rundown of the embedded OS’s eCos and uClinux as well as
  the real-time OS’s RTLinux and RTAI.  Disscussed how each could be
  applied to a certain set of problems and what to whatch out for when
  choosing a free operating system.

* *2000: Ericsson Mobile Data Design AB, Gothenburg.* A ten month
  project with extensive modifications of VxWorks and its microkernel
  Wind to support the HW microkernel developed by RealFast.  The latter
  is implemented in VHDL prototyped on a PMC card with an FPGA.

  The goal of the project was to compare the performance of VxWorks with
  and without the hardware acceleration.  This was done with a simple IP
  forwarding application running in VxWorks on the Ericsson GIC (General
  Interface Carrier) board.

  The project included debugging of IBM PowerPC 750 using IBM RISCWatch
  with a JTAG probe.  Including debugging of PCI drivers with SingleStep
  and the Vmetro PMC bus analyzer.

  Tests and performance measurements made for the evaluation of the
  project was, amongst other tools, carried out with an advanced IP
  packet generator.  The project also included modification and auditing
  of Ericsson developed drivers and base platform in VxWorks.

* *2000–2002: RealFast (internal work).* Network and systems
  administration of Linux, OpenBSD and Solaris machines.

  Ported VxWorks to the Real-Time Unit, RTU, a real-time kernel
  implemented in VHDL.  All kernel primitives in VxWorks were adapted to
  use the HW micro kernel.


Technical Experience
--------------------

Extensive knowledge of UNIX.  Both for systems administration and
development.  Intimate knowledge of C, MAke and the GNU configure and
build system.

Here are some of my projects at [GitHub][https://github.com/troglobit]:

finit
:   A fast and plugin based SysV init replacement focused on embedded
    systems.  Used in the Westermo WeOS network operating system.
    https://github.com/troglobit/finit

uftpd
:   Created my own FTP/TFTP server, because all others were
    completely useless.

    * FTP with basic anonymous support
    * TFTP with block-size negotiation

    https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd

watchdogd
:   Advanced watchdog daemon for Linux.  Supports loadavg, file descriptor
    and RAM usage monitoring.  Also, advanced heartbeat monitoring API for
    processes.

    https://github.com/troglobit/watchdogd

libuEv
:   Event based library for file descriptors, timers and signals.  Used in
    `uftpd`, `finit`, and `watchdogd`, as well as some other projects.
